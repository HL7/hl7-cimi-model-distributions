Note that attributes of the actor (an entity) that remain constant regardless of the role the actor plays should be part of the entity and not the role. For instance, a person may be a practitioner and a patient. In both cases their date of birth will be the same and thus such information should not be part of the role.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"cimi-entity-Role-model",0,*,"",""
