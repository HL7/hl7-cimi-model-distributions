"cimi-statement-ClinicalStatement-model","","","",0,*,"","","","","","A special type of information entry consisting of a topic and a context.
The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement classes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system. The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"cimi-statement-ClinicalStatement-model",0,*,"",""
