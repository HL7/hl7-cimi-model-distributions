Attribution provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.

Attribution provides a common reference model pattern that may be included directly within a clinical statement (e.g., the metadata associated with the recording of a clinical statement in a system) or within the Provenance pattern when it is preferrable to have such information external to but referencing the clinical statement (see Provenance). Note that, when included directly within a clinical statement, updates made to attribution attribute values will result in a versioning change in the instance. When part of the Provenance class, updates to provenance do not result in an update of the clinical statement referenced by the Provenance class (see Provenance.target).</div>

                        <div class="block">A special type of information entry consisting of a topic and a context.  The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement archetypes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system.

The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model. 

A clinical statement is composed of the StatementTopic class (grouping of attributes for capturing information about a procedure or a clinical finding) and the StatementContext class (grouping of attributes providing the context for the statement topic such as whether a procedure was performed, requested, not performed or whether a finding is suspected present or absent in the patient). At the archetype level, the topic and context components are coordinated to form the clinical statement. For instance, the composition of the ProcedureTopic with the NotPerformed context indicates that the given procedure was not performed.

Locatable defines a runtime name and an archetype_node_id. The archetype_node_id is the standardised semantic code for a node and comes from the corresponding node in the archetype used to create the data. The only exception is at archetype root points in data, where archetype_node_id carries the archetype identifier in string form rather than an interior node id from an archetype. Locatable also provides the attribute archetype_details, which is non-Void for archetype root points in data, and carries meta-data relevant to root points. The name attribute carries a name created at runtime. The &#39;meaning&#39; of any node is derived formally from the archetype by obtaining the text value for the archetype_node_id code from the archetype ontology section, in the language required.</div>

Note that although the term &quot;ordinal&quot; in mathematics means natural numbers only, here any integer is allowed, since negative and zero values are often used by medical professionals for values around a neutral point, for example {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3} for reflex response values.

The StatementContext class aligns with the SNOMED CT Situations with Explicit Context. The StatementContext provides the expressivity required to specify that an act was performed or not performed or that a finding was asserted to be present or absent for the given subject of information. It also often holds provenance information relevant to the context of the clinical statement. It is important to note that by default the context applies to the conjunction of the attribute specified in the statement. For instance, if a clinical statement has a topic describing a rash on left arm and a context of &#39;absent&#39;, then the statement states that the subject of interest did not have a rash on the left arm but might have had one on the right arm.</div>
