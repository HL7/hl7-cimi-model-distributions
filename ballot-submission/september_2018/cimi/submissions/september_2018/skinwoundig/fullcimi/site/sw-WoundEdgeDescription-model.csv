For action topics, the TopicCode represents the action being described. For findings, the TopicCode represents the 'question' or property being investigated. For evaluation result findings, the TopicCode contains a concept for an observable entity, such as systolic blood pressure. For assertion findings, the TopicCode contains a code representing the condition, allergy, or other item being asserted. In all cases, the TopicCode describes the topic  of the action or the finding.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"sw-WoundEdgeDescription-model.topicCode",0,1,"",""
