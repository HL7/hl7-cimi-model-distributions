","The concept representing the finding or action that is the topic of the statement.","The concept representing the finding or action that is the topic of the statement.

For action topics, the TopicCode represents the action being described. For findings, the TopicCode represents the 'question' or property being investigated. For evaluation result findings, the TopicCode contains a concept for an observable entity, such as systolic blood pressure. For assertion findings, the TopicCode contains a code representing the condition, allergy, or other item being asserted. In all cases, the TopicCode describes the topic  of the action or the finding.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"cimi-statement-EvaluationComponent-model.topicCode",0,1,"",""
