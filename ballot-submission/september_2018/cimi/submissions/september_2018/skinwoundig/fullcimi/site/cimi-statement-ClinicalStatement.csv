"DomainResource","","","",0,*,"","","","","SW ClinicalStatement Profile","A special type of information entry consisting of a topic and a context.
The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement classes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system. The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"",0,null,"","dom-2:If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT contain nested Resources {contained.contained.empty()}
