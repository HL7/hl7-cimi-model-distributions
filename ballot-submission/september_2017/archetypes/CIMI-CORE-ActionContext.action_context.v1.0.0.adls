Moreover, within each of these context, an action may have a set of allowable states in which it can exist. For instance, a proposal may be rejected or an order may be signed, canceled or superceded by another order. It is expected that set of such states will vary based on the type of action context. The status code must coincide with the activity code of one of the attribution elements of statusHistory if a context status history is provided.">
